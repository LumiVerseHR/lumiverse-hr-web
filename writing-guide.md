## Writing Principles

### 1. Lead with Impact
Start with the most important thing. Don't bury the value.

**Before:** "Our flagship AI platform that simplifies integration and automation for businesses of all sizes."

**After:** "Our internal platform for rapid AI deployment. Pre-built components, tested integrations, battle-hardened infrastructure."

### 2. Be Specific, Not Vague
Replace generic claims with concrete details.

**Before:** "Access to a comprehensive database of curated articles"

**After:** "200,000+ articles indexed. Market trends, industry analysis, business intelligence."

### 3. Cut the Fluff
Remove words that don't add meaning.

**Before:** "Strategic guidance on implementing AI technologies to maximize ROI and business impact."

**After:** "We analyze your business processes and identify where AI creates the most impact. Clear roadmaps, realistic timelines, measurable outcomes."

### 4. Use Active Voice
Subject does the action. More direct, more engaging.

**Before:** "Data-driven insights are provided to help you make better business decisions."

**After:** "Machine learning models that forecast trends, detect anomalies, and surface insights hidden in your data."

### 5. Write Like You Talk
If you wouldn't say it in a meeting, don't write it.

**Before:** "Implementation of LumiFlows.ai platform for automated business operations"

**After:** "When off-the-shelf doesn't cut it, we build from scratch."

## Content Structure Changes

### Headlines

**Before:** Generic, feature-focused
- "Our Services"
- "Our Solutions"
- "Our Projects"

**After:** Action-oriented, benefit-focused
- "What We Do" → "Services"
- "Our Platform" → "LumiFlows.ai"
- "Case Studies" → "Selected Work"

### Section Labels
Added small uppercase labels above headlines for context:
- "WHAT WE DO"
- "CASE STUDIES"
- "HOW WE WORK"
- "GET IN TOUCH"

### Hero Headlines

**Before:**
> "Business Process Optimization with AI Implementation"

**After:**
> "We build intelligent systems"

The new approach:
- Massive, bold statement
- Three lines for rhythm
- Middle word gets gradient treatment
- Simple, memorable

### Subheadlines

**Before:** Long, trying to say everything
> "We develop artificial intelligence solutions to automate business processes, analyze data patterns, and optimize operational efficiency."

**After:** Focused, benefit-driven
> "Artificial intelligence that automates processes, uncovers patterns in data, and transforms how businesses operate. From concept to deployment."

## Service Descriptions

### Pattern: Problem → Solution → Proof

> "Strategic guidance on implementing AI technologies to maximize ROI and business impact."

**After (Value-Focused):**
> "We analyze your business processes and identify where AI creates the most impact. Clear roadmaps, realistic timelines, measurable outcomes. No hype, just results."

Structure:
1. What we do (concrete action)
2. What you get (tangible outcomes)
3. Differentiator (why us)

---

## Project/Case Study Content

### Title Treatment

**Before:** Descriptive but flat
> "Pitaj Lider - AI-Powered Business Intelligence Assistant"

**After:** Name prominent, subtitle separate
> **Pitaj Lider**
> Business intelligence assistant that transforms how professionals access market data.

### Project Descriptions

**Before (Technical Focus):**
> "AI assistant for business research and data analysis, providing access to structured market intelligence and company registry information through natural language processing."

### Technical Challenges

**Before (Passive, Vague):**
> "Complex AI and computer vision challenges overcome during the digitization process"

**After (Active, Specific):**
> "Magazine layouts break standard document processing. Multi-column text, images that split articles, content that spans pages - this required custom AI."

The new approach:
- State the problem clearly
- Explain why it's hard
- Show we solved it

---

## CTA (Call-to-Action) Copy

### Primary CTAs

**Before:** Generic
- "Get Started"
- "Learn More"
- "Request Demo"

**After:** Specific, action-oriented
- "Start a Project"
- "View Our Work"

**After:** Specific action

## Stats & Numbers

### Presentation

**Before:** Buried in text
> "Access to 200,000+ curated articles covering market trends..."

**After:** Prominent, scannable
```
200K+          Real-time       NLP            24/7
Articles       Company Data    Queries        Available
```

### Number Formatting
- Use shorthand: "200K+" not "200,000+"

- Add context: "Decades of Archive Content"

---

## Process Descriptions

### Before (Passive, Corporate):
> "Strategic guidance on implementing AI technologies"

### After (Active, Step-by-Step):

**01. Discovery**
> "We dig into your processes, data, and goals. Identify quick wins and long-term opportunities."

**02. Design**
> "Architecture decisions, technology selection, proof-of-concept development."

**03. Build**
> "Iterative development with frequent demos. You see progress weekly, not monthly."

**04. Deploy**
> "Production launch, monitoring setup, team training. We stick around until it works."

Key changes:
- Numbered steps
- Short, punchy descriptions
- Client-focused ("you see progress")
- Commitment statement ("we stick around")

---

## Contact Section

### Before (Formal):
> "Contact us to discuss AI implementation for your business requirements."

- Question format ("Have a project in mind?")

---

## 404 Page

### Before (Standard):
> "Looks like you've ventured into the digital void. The page you're looking for doesn't exist."

### After (On-brand):
> **"Lost in the void"**
> "The page you're looking for doesn't exist or has been moved. Let's get you back on track."

- Shorter headline
- Maintains brand voice
- Helpful, not apologetic

---

## Footer Tagline

### Before:
> "Making AI accessible for everyone"

### After:
> "AI solutions that transform how businesses operate. Based in Zagreb, working globally."

More specific, grounds the company geographically while showing global reach.

## Word Choice Guidelines

### Replace These:

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| utilize | use |
| leverage | use, apply |
| solution | system, tool, platform |
| cutting-edge | modern, advanced |
| state-of-the-art | latest, current |
| synergy | (delete) |
| paradigm | (delete) |
| holistic | complete, full |
| robust | reliable, solid |
| seamless | smooth, easy |
| empower | help, enable |

### Preferred Terms:

| Generic | Specific |
|---------|----------|
| AI solution | AI assistant, document AI, automation system |
| data | articles, records, documents, registry data |

## Sentence Length

- **Headlines:** 3-7 words
- **Subheadlines:** 15-25 words
- **Body paragraphs:** Mix of short (8-12 words) and medium (15-20 words)
- **Feature items:** 5-10 words each

Vary rhythm. Short sentence. Then a longer one that expands on the idea and provides more context. Then short again.

## Checklist for New Content

- [ ] Does the headline make a bold statement?
- [ ] Is the benefit clear in the first sentence?
- [ ] Are there specific numbers or details?
- [ ] Is it in active voice?
- [ ] Could any words be cut?
- [ ] Would you say this out loud?
